# Project: Identify Dog Breeds using a CNN Model
A project completed on Udacity as part of AI Programming with Python Nanodegree programme


## Description
In this project, I used a pre-trained image classifier to identify dog breeds from different dog images.


## Goal
The purpose of the project was to improve python programming skills rather than create and train a CNN model.


## About the Models 
While working on this project, I explored three different architectures (AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet) and determined which was best for my application.


## Objectives
• Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if the breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.

• Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.

• Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve objectives 1 and 2.

• Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms takes to run.
